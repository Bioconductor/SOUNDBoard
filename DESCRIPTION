Description: This package provides facilities for producing reports
    that communicate results of multi-'Omics analyses. The reports are
    destined for consumption by tumor board or other clinician /
    scientist entities, rather than bioinformaticians. The reports
    adopt a consistent interface to result presentation. Guiding
    principles include: inclusion of uncertainty; appropriate color
    schemes and layouts; appropriate interactivity; re-use across
    studies. The work is part of the SOUND project
    (http://www.sound-biomed.eu/), with funding from the European
    Commission H2020 program.
